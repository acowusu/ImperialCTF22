## Mission

Before we begin, here are some more details:

The challenges are divided into categories based on the techniques they involve.

We recommend that you start with the easy ones and slowly build your way up towards the harder ones.

There are three levels of difficulty:

* Easy - 50 / 75 points
* Medium - 100 points
* Hard - 200 points

While harder problems are intended to have fewer solves, the moderators may release hints that should point you in the right direction. All hints will be released on our Discord server.

You do not lose points if you submit incorrect flags, but we limited the number of submissions per challenge to 100 in order to discourage brute-forcing. If you ever feel that you obtained the correct flag, but something is wrong, please contact the author of the challenge on Discord for clarification.

Important: please join our Discord server otherwise you might miss important things!

Without further ado, let the hacking begin!
