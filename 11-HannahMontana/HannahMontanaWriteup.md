# 11 - Hannah Montana

**CTF name:** Imperial CTF 22 Qualifiers<br>
**Challenge name:** Hannah Montana<br>
**Challenge description:** What is my dog's name?<br>
**Challenge category:** OSInt <br>
**Challenge points:** 75 (Medium/Easy) <br>

We first looked up if there are any dogs in Hannah Montana.
We found that there was a dog named Oscar so we tried the flag ICTF{Oscar} and various variations with casing but that did not work.

So we looked up Miley Cyrus' dog names (Plays Hannah Montana) and found that she had many dogs so we tried each of their names but that did not work either.

We reasoned that it can't be a combination of Miley Cyrus' dog names as were limited to 100 flag guesses per question.

So we took the question more literally and reasoned it might be the challenge author's dog.

We messaged the author directly but they did not say what their dog's name was.

So we looked up the author's username `PANGV2001` and found their real name was `Gavriil Panayiotis`

We first looked through the author's LinkedIn but there was no information on dogs.

So we then looked through the author's Facebook and looked through their photos.

Scrolling down the photos we found 3 photos of a dog, [in one of the photos](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=734265183318941&set=pb.100002063996513.-2207520000..) we found the flag in the photo's caption.
