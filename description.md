Alert! Alert! Agent Lee's cover has been blown! He needs immediate extraction!
He has managed to contact us just in time and we sent a helicopter to pick him up.
Unfortunately, he transmitted the wrong coordinates. To make things worse, he
needs to navigate a huge maze. His position is marked with an L in the maze, while
our helicopter is marked with an H.
We extracted a satellitle image of the maze and marked the walls with #. We need
you to find a path that agent Lee can follow in order to get to safety.
Provide the path as one long line of characters L, R, U, D which symbolise taking
a step left, right, up or down.

  Example:
  L # # # # #
  O O O # O #
  # O # # O #
  O O # O O O
  O # # O # O
  O O O O O H

  Path (any correct solution is accepted):
